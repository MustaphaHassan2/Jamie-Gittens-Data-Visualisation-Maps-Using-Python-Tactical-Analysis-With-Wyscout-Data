This repository contains a series of custom-built data visualisation maps that support a full tactical analysis of Jamie Gittensâ€™ performances with Borussia Dortmund across the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons.

The project was developed using Python and includes:

Shot location maps with xG overlay

xG performance comparison charts

Goal distribution maps

Dribbling action maps showing volume, direction, and outcomes

Progressive pass and carry maps

Defensive contribution visualisations (interceptions, losses, recoveries)

The maps were built from scratch using matplotlib, mplsoccer, pandas, and numpy, based on structured event data exported from Wyscout. Each plot replicates the visual style seen in professional football analytics, adapted for clear tactical insight.

The repository demonstrates how Python can be used to create high-quality, tactical football visualisations for scouting reports and performance profiling.

Suitable for analysts, scouts, and developers working at the intersection of data science and football.
